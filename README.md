# Weather-App-Development-Project

## Simple overview of use/purpose

The Weather App Development Project is dedicated to creating a simple and user-friendly mobile application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location. The app focuses on minimalism, only requiring access to your location to deliver accurate and timely weather updates.

## Description

The Weather App is designed to offer users up-to-date weather information for their current location. To ensure accuracy, the app requests access to your device's location, but it does not collect or store any personal data.
